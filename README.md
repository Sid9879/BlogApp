🛠️ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and run the BlogApp locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sid9879/BlogApp.git
cd BlogApp

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blogapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

Replace your_jwt_secret_key with a strong, random string.

Start the MongoDB server:
Ensure your MongoDB instance is running. If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can follow the official MongoDB documentation or use Docker.

Run the application:

npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port you specified in .env). 🚀

📚 Project Structure
The project is organized into logical directories for maintainability and scalability:

./controllers: Contains the business logic and request handlers for different routes.

./middleware: Houses custom Express middleware functions (e.g., authentication.

./models: Defines the Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections (e.g., User, Post).

./routes: Sets up the API endpoints and maps them to their respective controller functions.

./views: Holds the server-side rendered templates (e.g., .ejs).

./index.js: The main entry point of the application, responsible for server setup, database connection, and route registration.
